            <p>This website uses Hue and Saturation to display today, tommorow and every day in the future as a colour. 
                Each date is a bar that is 20 pixels high and stretches across the website. 
                The colour of the month is calculated by using the Hue scale (0-360) with 0 being January and 360 being December.
                The colour of the day is calculated by using the Saturation scale (0-100) with 0 being the 1st day of the month and 100 being the 31st day of the month.
